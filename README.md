# LAVA Smart Contracts

Welcome to the official repository for the LAVA smart contracts, hosted at [lavaflows.xyz](https://lavaflows.xyz). LAVA is an innovative ERC20 token designed to provide stability and long-term growth to its ecosystem through a sophisticated implementation of transaction taxes and an automated financial backstop.

## Overview

The LAVA smart contract introduces an advanced ERC20 token aimed at maintaining the token's value and fostering the ecosystem's sustainability. It incorporates a financial backstop and a transaction tax mechanism to stabilize the token price and support ecosystem development.

## Core Features

### Automated Financial Backstop

- **Funding:** Funds are collected via transaction taxes and direct contributions in both Ether and LAVA.
- **Stabilization:** A backstop pool has been established to stabilize the token's value, exchangeable for Ether on Uniswap V2 under specific conditions like time elapsed and amount accumulated.
- **Access and Security:** The backstop value is stored directly on the contract and can be accessed only by burning $LAVA tokens.

### Transaction Tax Mechanism

- **Tax Rate:** Each transaction incurs a 2% tax by default, with 0.4% allocated towards funding development.
- **Flexibility:** The owner can adjust the tax rate within a 0-2% range to respond to changing economic conditions.

### Token Redemption and Burning

- **Deflationary Approach:** Users can burn their LAVA tokens to redeem 90% of the proportional amount of ETH from the backstop pool, reducing the total token supply and increasing the value per remaining token.
- **Price Support:** This mechanism supports the tokenâ€™s price by reducing supply and providing direct value back to the token holders.

### Owner Privileges and Safeguards

- **No Minting:** New tokens cannot be minted, ensuring a fixed or diminishing supply.
- **Airdrops:** Token airdrops can be conducted for promotional purposes and initial distribution.
- **Tax Exemptions:** Specific addresses may be exempted from transaction taxes to facilitate automated transactions or complex processes.

### Uniswap Integration for Liquidity

- **Liquidity and Swaps:** The contract uses Uniswap V2 for swapping tokens, which enhances liquidity and facilitates the automatic conversion of tokens into ETH under defined conditions.

### Operational Transparency

- **Event Logging:** The contract emits events for significant actions like token burns, airdrops, and swaps, ensuring all stakeholders can track the token's and funds' movements transparently.
